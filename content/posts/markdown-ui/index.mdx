Since a few years ago the idea of a [Second Brain](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/)
has been resonating with me. The capability to store an infinite amount of
information interesting to me and be able to sort it, categorize it and create
relations between items, lets you increase the knowledge in many topics in this
world and improve day by day.


After trying and evaluate many solutions out there like
[Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/), [Notion](https://workflowy.com/) and now
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), it is clear to me that the best approach to
store this kind of information is simple Markdown files. The simplicity and the
capability to backup it somewhere is the main reason to follow this way.

But coming from Notion, I miss some nice features like kanban views, calendars, or
tables. Something that doesn't come out of the box in the Markdown spec.

One cool approach to store complex information in markdowns is by the block of
code prefixed by &#96;&#96;&#96;. You have seen this popular syntax in many source control
to show syntax highlighting of different programing languages.

## Goal

In this post, I want to explore and experiment with the possibilities of using this
approach to store more rich information, like the one required to model a kanban board.
The requirement is to be always able to store back to plain text for markdown
files. This idea is not new and it is implemented in other places like
[Github todos](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-task-lists),
[kanbans](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coddx.coddx-alpha)
or [complex UML diagrams](https://plantuml.com/). To shine with this small
project, I wanted to play with some technology new to me like
[WASM](https://webassembly.org/).

To let you know which is the vision of this project you can check the
conceptual lifecycle of the information in the diagram:

Also, I wanted to refresh my knowledge about lexers and parsers, taking the
opportunity to implement them in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## First step: Parsing

To be able to validate the idea and achieve the minimum viable product, we will
take the easiest example to play with. We are going to build an interactive
markdown table. All values in this table will be floats. This is an example of
the content:

````
```table
2.3,6,9
12,3.44,5
9,2,2
```
````

First of all, we need a grammar, similar to CSV structure, and we are going to
use [Parsing Expression Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar)
(PEG). This grammar could be implemented in
Javascript with a library like [pegjs](https://pegjs.org/), but since we are
implementing this step in Rust, we are going to use
[pest-rs](https://bitbegin.github.io/pest-rs/) crate.

The grammar needs to support floats for each one of the cells, called in this
case `Field`. Then, a list of floats separated commas will form the rows of the
table, in this case, called `Record`. Then a `File` will be a list of `Record`
separated by break lines:

```peg
Field = { (ASCII_DIGIT | "." | "-")+ }
Record = { Field ~ ("," ~ Field)* }
File = { SOI ~ (Record ~ ("\r\n" | "\n"))* ~ EOI }
```

We need to understand that this grammar doesn't include the classic Markdown
_fence_ because this responsability belongs to the Markdown parser.

Once we have a nice grammar definition, we can use it to build the parser.
Pest is going to build all the utility modules to be able to parse the incoming
data to abstract syntax tree nodes.

First, it generates the required `Enum`'s to be able to differentiate the
parsed tokens.

```rust
pub enum Rule {
    EOI,
    Field,
    Record,
    File,
}
```

On the other hand, it generates a parser to build the correct tree of nodes:

```rust
extern crate pest;
#[macro_use]
extern crate pest_derive;

use std::fs;
use pest::Parser;

#[derive(Parser)]
#[grammar = "csv.pest"]
pub struct CSVParser;

fn main() {
    // A sample how to parse a cell / field from our grammar:
    let successful_parse = CSVParser::parse(Rule::Field, "-273.15");
    println!("{:?}", successful_parse);

    let unparsed_file = fs::read_to_string("./samples/test.csv").expect("cannot read file");

    let file = CSVParser::parse(Rule::File, &unparsed_file)
      .expect("unsuccessful parse") // unwrap the parse result
      .next().unwrap(); // get and unwrap the `file` rule; never fails

    // Print the parsed abstract syntax tree
    println!("AST: {:?}", file);
}
```

If we run this code with the `test.csv` as input, we are going to get:

```rust
Pair {
	rule: File,
	span: Span { str: "2.3,6,9\n12,3.44,5\n9,2,2\n", start: 0, end: 24 },
	inner: [
		Pair {
			rule: Record,
			span: Span { str: "2.3,6,9", start: 0, end: 7 },
			inner: [
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "2.3", start: 0, end: 3 }, inner: [] },
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "6", start: 4, end: 5 }, inner: [] },
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "9", start: 6, end: 7 }, inner: [] }
			]
		},
		Pair {
			rule: Record,
			span: Span { str: "12,3.44,5", start: 8, end: 17 },
			inner: [
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "12", start: 8, end: 10 }, inner: [] },
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "3.44", start: 11, end: 15 }, inner: [] },
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "5", start: 16, end: 17 }, inner: [] }
			]
		},
		Pair {
			rule: Record,
			span: Span { str: "9,2,2", start: 18, end: 23 },
			inner: [
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "9", start: 18, end: 19 }, inner: [] },
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "2", start: 20, end: 21 }, inner: [] },
				Pair { rule: Field, span: Span { str: "2", start: 22, end: 23 }, inner: [] }
			]
		},
		Pair { rule: EOI, span: Span { str: "", start: 24, end: 24 }, inner: [] }
	]
}
```

## Second step: Render

Now that we the required structures to keep the AST of the table, we are
going to send them as objects to Javascript world. Those objects will be the
source that will feed some UI build on top of libraries like [React](https://reactjs.org/)
or [Vue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar). In
this case, we are going to follow the React path.

Those [DTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) will be
represented by Rust struct, and will hold the parsed information in previous
steps. To be able to go from WASM to Javascript, we have to add `Serialize` and
`Deserialize` traits to our structures.

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Field {
    pub value: f32,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct Record {
    pub fields: Vec<Field>,
}
```

Thanks to [wasm-bindgen](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/) and
[wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack), we are able to build a
package that includes a declaration of a `parse` function that can be called
from Javascript world:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn parse(source: &str) -> JsValue {
  let file = CSVParser::parse(Rule::File, source)
    .expect("unsuccessful parse") // unwrap the parse result
    .next().unwrap(); // get and unwrap the `file` rule; never fails

  let mut records = vec!();

  for record in file.into_inner() {
    match record.as_rule() {
      Rule::Record => {
        let fields = record.into_inner().map(|field| {
          Field {
            value: field.as_str().parse::<f32>().unwrap()
          }
        }).collect();

        records.push(Record {
          fields
        })
      }
      Rule::EOI => (),
      _ => unreachable!(),
    }
  }

  JsValue::from_serde(&records).unwrap()
}
```

This function will return `JsValue`'s with a representation of our `Field` and
`Record` structures. Those objects will be used to render a nice and
interactive UI build on top of React.

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  // Retrieve it from markdown
  const source = "2.3,6,9\n12,3.44,5\n9,2,2\n"

  const [parse, setParse] = React.useState(() => {})
  const [records, setRecords] = React.useState([])

  React.useEffect(() => {
    import('./csvlib').then(({ parse }
    ) => {
      setRecords(parse(source))
      setParse(() => parse)
    })
  }, [])

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <table className="table-auto border-collapse border border-green-800">
        <tbody>
          {records.map((record, index) => (
            <tr key={index}>
              {record.fields.map((field, index) => (
                <td key={index} className="border-2 border-green-600 px-6 py-2">
                  {field.value}
                </td>
              ))}
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

## Third step: Interaction

Now that we are able to render the parsed content, we can continue adding a bit
of interactivity to the view. You can imagine whatever nice use case for your
widget. From adding buttons, drag and drop, calendars, etc.

For demo purposes, we are going to add just a button to add new rows to
the table.

![](table.png)

This button will modify the internal state of Javascript objects that represent those
records and the UI will react accordingly.

## Fourth step: Serialization

Finally, the last step in this cycle is to serialize the React state back to
Markdown plain text. To do this, we will call again a WASM function to
compute this. With this approach, we encapsulate all the logic about parsing and
serializing in the same WASM module. To achieve this, we are going to code the
`store` function and expose it to `wasm_bindgen`:

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn store(js_objects: JsValue) -> JsValue {
  let records: Vec<Record> = js_objects.into_serde().unwrap();

  let value = records
    .iter()
    .map(|record| {
      record
        .fields
        .iter()
        .map(|field| {
          field.value.to_string()
        })
        .collect::<Vec<_>>()
        .join(",")
    })
    .collect::<Vec<_>>()
    .join("\n");

  JsValue::from_serde(&value).unwrap()
}
```

Then, we call this new function from React passing as argument all rows in the
table from the state:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  ...
  const [store, setStore] = React.useState(() => {})

  React.useEffect(() => {
    import('./csvlib').then(({ parse, store }
    ) => {
      ...
      setStore(() => store)
    })
  }, [])

  const onRetrieve = () => {
    const source = store(records)
    const markdown = `\`\`\`\n${source}\n\`\`\``

    console.log('Markdown:')
    console.log(markdown)
  }

  return (
    ...
  );
}
export default App;
```

And we get the final goal of new Markdown 🎉 for this dynamic table component:

````
```table
2.3,6,9
12,3.44,5
9,2,2
1,2,3
```
````

## Conclusion

We went through all the steps required to parse arbitrary data to feed a reactive
UI and close the cycle back to text. As we said, the possibilities of this
approach for markdown documentation or more rich second brains are endless.
